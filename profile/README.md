## Climate and Extremes Data Science
Based in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Maryland, College Park

Welcome! Our research focuses on the application of machine learning tools (e.g. neural networks) and numerical modeling systems (e.g. CESM) to answer pressing questions in the domains of climate and extremes.
